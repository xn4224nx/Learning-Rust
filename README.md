# Learning Rust

A collection of the completed exercise script files created when learning the Rust Language.

## Resources Used

The resources used in learning are as follows:

1.  [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - a starter text endorsed by the Rust foundation. 

2.  [Command-Line Rust: A Project-Based Primer for Writing Rust CLIs](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/) - teaches Rust using a single small, complete, focused program in each chapter.

3.  [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) - A comprehensive text going over the full Rust language.

4.  [Rust in Action](https://github.com/rust-in-action) - Introduces the Rust programming language by exploring numerous systems programming concepts and techniques.

## Future Resources

Some viable books to use in future learing

1.  [Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust) - Each chapter in this book presents hands-on, practical projects ranging from “Hello, World” to building a full dungeon crawler game.

2. [Effective Rust: 35 Specific Ways to Improve Your Rust Code](https://effective-rust.com/) -  By focusing on the conceptual differences between Rust and other compiled languages, and by providing specific recommendations that programmers can easily follow, Effective Rust will soon have you writing fluent Rust, not just badly translated C++.

3. [Write Powerful Rust Macros](https://www.manning.com/books/write-powerful-rust-macros) - Supercharge your code with macros—the real power tools of the Rust programming language!

4. [Code Like a Pro in Rust](https://www.manning.com/books/code-like-a-pro-in-rust) - Code Like a Pro in Rust dives deep into memory management, asynchronous programming, and the core Rust skills that make you a Rust pro! Plus, you’ll find essential productivity techniques for Rust testing, tooling, and project management.

5. [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/) - The reader-friendly The Algorithm Design Manual provides straightforward access to combinatorial algorithms technology, stressing design over analysis. The first part, Techniques, provides accessible instruction on methods for designing and analyzing computer algorithms. The second part, Resources, is intended for browsing and reference, and comprises the catalog of algorithmic resources, implementations and an extensive bibliography. 

6. [Practical Rust Projects](https://github.com/Apress/Practical-Rust-Projects-2nd-ed.) - Go beyond the basics and build complete applications using the Rust programming language, updated for Rust 2021 edition. The applications you'll build over the course of this book include a high-performance web client, an embedded computer (for a robot, for example), a game, a serverless web app, and an application that incorporates AI and machine learning.  
  
8. [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://github.com/m-ou-se/rust-atomics-and-locks) - In this practical book, Mara Bos, team lead of the Rust library team, helps Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. You’ll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you’re done, you’ll have a firm grasp of how Rust’s memory model, the processor, and the role of the operating system all fit together.

9. [Effective Rust](https://effective-rust.com/) - Rust's popularity is growing, due in part to features like memory safety, type safety, and thread safety. But these same elements can also make learning Rust a challenge, even for experienced programmers. This practical guide helps you make the transition to writing idiomatic Rust--while also making full use of Rust's type system, safety guarantees, and burgeoning ecosystem.
